## Project Overview

I created this repository while I was learning from Andrej Karpathy's videos based on makemore. We have to make new words given a collection of 32k random words/names. The models implemented in this project include:

- Bigram model
- Simple neural network model
- Multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
- Transformer model
